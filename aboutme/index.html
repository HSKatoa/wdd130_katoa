    <p>Yo fellow slaves. 
        I guess I must let you know who I am. 
        I’m definitely not married and disgustingly single, so yeah I’m going on a long sabbatical to distract myself from this apparent failure. 
        I have no children that I am aware of, thankfully. 
        I’m from Phoenix Arizona, which is as cold as the devils butt (I would use a different word, but I’d probably get honor coded lol). 
        It’s a mad fun town if you know what you’re doing. 
        I’d recommend partying it up with the vinyl DJs at Valley Bar, get a chopped cheese at Gracie’s Tax Bar, and dance the night away with some gay tacos at Charlie’s.</p>
    <p>Been a bloody Mormon since I was essentially born. 
        Didn’t really believe till I was like midway through high school. 
        I love the gospel; I just often hate the culture. 
        But I always think of what Marcus Aurelius said, “Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself.” 
        So, I’m out here striving to be very tolerant of the mollys and peters. 
        But yeah, I know it’s true and I love it, especially He who did more then all for me and everything.</p>
    <p>I’m a senior who’s feeling mad trunky on his last semester. 
        Right now, I’m doing my internship as some financial analyst for one of the property firms in town. 
        I’ll be graduating with a BS in Finance so that’s funny. 
        I’m going on a long sabbatical into Southeast Asia after graduation. 
        I often tell people, “I’m going to be knee deep in lady boys.”</p>
    <p>Anyways, I’m sure you want to get back to doing something cooler then reading this crap. 
        So, peace and blessings yo.</p>
